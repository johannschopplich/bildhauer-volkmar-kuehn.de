## What is this?

This is the website source code for the sculptor [Volkmar Kühn](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkmar_K%C3%BChn), a German sculptor known for his works displayed in public spaces, particularly in Gera (the town I grew up in). Since 1968, he has been living and working in the former Mildenfurth monastery, which the logo represents.

The artist lacks exposure on the interweb, so I decided to build a website for him. The website is built with [Kirby](https://getkirby.com), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev).

## Installation

1. Duplicate the [`.env.development.example`](./.env.development.example) as `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.development.example .env
```

2. Install the required Node dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Install the required Composer dependencies:

```bash
composer install
```

## Usage

### Development

1. Start the Vite development server and watch for file changes accordingly:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

2. Run the built-in PHP web server or use a development web server of your choice (like [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/valet)).

```bash
composer start
```

### Production

Build the frontend assets for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

If you have caching enabled, make sure to wipe the cache after each build:

```bash
rm -rf storage/cache/<your-website>
```

### Deployment

> ℹ️ See [ploi-deploy.sh](./scripts/ploi-deploy.sh) for deployment instructions.

> ℹ️ For Apache web servers: Some hosting environments require uncommenting `RewriteBase /` in [`.htaccess`](./public/.htaccess) to make site links work.
